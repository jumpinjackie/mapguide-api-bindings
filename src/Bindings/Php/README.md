# PHP wrapper notes

This document describes the PHP language binding for the MapGuide API

# Supported PHP version

This binding targets PHP 7.1.18, the current PHP version in the 7.1 series

# Known issues

 * Some APIs with many overloads may have incorrect wrapper code generated by vanilla SWIG. We've been working around this by monkey-patching away such problematic APIs. Please report any APIs that do not behave as they did in the official PHP 5.x binding.

 * If you have multiple try/catch blocks within the same scope, make sure to use different exception variable names. For example:

 ```
 try {
   //Some code that throws
 } catch (MgException $ex) {
   //Handle this exception
 }

 try {
   //Some more code that throws
 } catch (MgException $ex) {
   //$ex from previous catch block is not properly cleaned up and will leak memory. You should use a different variable name here
 }
 ```

# Differences from the official PHP binding

 * Usage
   * You will need to include `MapGuideApi.php` to access the MapGuide API.

 * Removed classes/APIs
   * `MgLayerBase::MgLayerBase`
   * `MgMapBase::Open`
   * `MgResource::Save`
   * `MgConfigurationException::GetExceptionMessage`
   * `MgSerializable` This is only a "marker" class for server/webtier serialization plumbing. Needed to be removed so that `MgException` can be rebased against PHP `Exception` to make it throwable.
