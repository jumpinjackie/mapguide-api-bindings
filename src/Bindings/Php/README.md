# PHP wrapper notes

This document describes the PHP language binding for the MapGuide API

# Supported PHP version

This binding targets PHP 7.1.18, the current PHP version in the 7.1 series

# Known issues

 * Any `MgException`-derived exception that is thrown currently leaks memory.
 * Some APIs with many overloads may have incorrect wrapper code generated by vanilla SWIG. We've been working around this by monkey-patching away such problematic APIs. Please report any APIs that do not behave as they did in the official PHP 5.x binding.

# Differences from the official PHP binding

 * Usage
   * You will need to include `MapGuideApi.php` to access the MapGuide API.

 * Removed classes/APIs
   * `MgLayerBase` constructor. Generally insignificant for PHP as there won't be alternate subclasses besides `MgLayer`
   * `MgSerializable` This is only a "marker" class for server/webtier serialization plumbing. Needed to be removed so that `MgException` can be rebased against PHP `Exception` to make it throwable.
