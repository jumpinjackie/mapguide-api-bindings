# PHP wrapper notes

This document describes the PHP language binding for the MapGuide API

# Supported PHP version

This binding targets the Windows release of PHP 7.1.18, the current PHP version in the 7.1 series.

No binding is provided for PHP 7.1 on Linux at this point in time as none of the Linux distros where we provide MapGuide binaries for (CentOS 6.x / Ubuntu 14.04), provide an official PHP 7.x package.

# Known issues

 * Some APIs with many overloads may have incorrect wrapper code generated by vanilla SWIG. We've been working around this by monkey-patching away such problematic APIs. Please report any APIs that do not behave as they did in the official PHP 5.x binding.

 * If you have multiple try/catch blocks within the same scope, make sure to use different exception variable names. For example:

 ```
 try {
   //Some code that throws
 } catch (MgException $ex) {
   //Handle this exception
 }

 try {
   //Some more code that throws
 } catch (MgException $ex) {
   //$ex from previous catch block is not properly cleaned up and will leak memory. You should use a different variable name here
 }
 ```

# Differences from the official PHP binding

 * Usage
   * You will need to include `MapGuideApi.php` to access the MapGuide API.

 * Removed classes/APIs
   * `MgLayerBase::MgLayerBase`
   * `MgMapBase::Open`
   * `MgResource::Save`
   * `MgConfigurationException::GetExceptionMessage`
   * `MgSerializable` This is only a "marker" class for server/webtier serialization plumbing. Needed to be removed so that `MgException` can be rebased against PHP `Exception` to make it throwable.
